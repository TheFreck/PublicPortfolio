A software craftsman will take pride in their work and build quality in from the beginning. This is accomplished by keeping up to date with modern philosophies and paradigms of programming as well as keeping skills sharp through personal projects, katas and open source contributions. A craftsman will always be learning and always eager to share knowledge and insights with peers.

                In <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" target="_blank">Clean Architecture</a> "Uncle Bob" takes a deep dive into the concept of Separation of Concerns which in a way is an extension to the <em>Single Responsibility</em> principal of SOLID. If each module is its own <em>black box</em> as it were, with its own context then the overall architecture will be simpler, cleaner and more maintainable. For each module to have its own encapsulation it will need to have access to its dependencies through <em>Inversion of Control</em>, or <em>Dependency Injection</em>, again tying back to SOLID. Organizing the code into self contained <em>"layers"</em> will ultimately lead to clean architecture.

                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194338.Lean_Software_Development" target="_blank">LEAN</a> is an amazing methodology that addresses the extreme leverage the developer has over outcomes. Decisions made today have a compounding effect and given the pace of development, flaws in the system become tech debt that will have to compete with new initiatives down the road. As a result quality must be built in from the beginning. This gives rise to concepts like delayed decision making until as much is known as possible. That way the best decision is made and does not need to be revisited because new information comes to light. Of course perfect decisions require the kind of hindsight that is not available to the decision maker and so flexibility is key. Overall, LEAN methodology fosters quality and adaptability that will live long after the original decisions have been made.

Most of us have walked around with our fly down or mustard on our chin. When we realize all of our friends were too embarrassed to point out our blind spot we have been walking around drawing attention for a lot longer than we should have been. However, when a rival shames us for something we didn't realize we were doing we feel defensive and not open to feedback. The balance comes when we speak directly and empathetically. Obviously this has business application but it has an equally powerful affect on our personsal relationships.

We only have so much in our emotional reserve and when it runs out we can't respond to life's many demands. Being mindful about how we invest our emotional capital can free us up to care about the things we actually do value.

Some of the most interesting insights are in the definition of complexity which he describes as a system composed of individual agents making decisions based on decisions made by other individual agents. This creates a constantly shifting landscape that is shaped less like the Apalachean Range of "complicated" peaks and valleys and not at all like Mt. Fuji with "simple" slopes that all lead to the top, and more like a lake whose "complex" waves are constantly cresting and dissipating relative to the waves immediately next to them.

                I enjoyed his course on complexity so much that I went in for another. In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17912024-the-hidden-factor" target="_blank">this course</a> he discusses the benefits of diversity from a variety of perspectives. Gender diversity brings the strengths of men, women and non-binary individuals to bear while cultural diversity opens up the individuals from all corners of the globe to bring their power to problem solving. All of his examples point to the true value which is diversity of perspective and life experiences. Women have had to navigate a different set of obstacles than men; black people a different set than white; foreigners a defferent set still than natural born citizens. All of these forms of diversity are a proxy for what is truly important. When understood in this way diversity can bring together problem solving strategies not available to those who have experienced life differently. In the end diversity has the capacity to solve a much larger set of problems.

In the past comfort has pushed us to innovate the bow and arrow and the basket to collect berries. For prior generations comfort was so expensive as to be a luxury good in economic parlance and its high cost meant that not many could afford enough of it to realize its danger. Today comfort means a thermostat set to 70 degrees and the knowledge that milk and eggs are only a five minute drive away. The economic success of humanity has reduced the cost so far that the poor mental health that once only afflicted royal families has now reached the middle class.

Why is Beethoven's Ode to Joy widely recognized as one of the greatest pieces of music to have been created? Is it because of the ebb and flow of emotion one feels while listening to it? That's even harder to pin down than quality itself.

                While this book was first published in the 1970's its implications have a lot to say about our current development of AI. Software lives on precise definitions. Binary is an either or. However, the complexity of Large Language Models has given us text that sounds human; art that looks human and facts that are anything BUT reliable. Given the fact that poetry generated by AI has the capacity to create a powerful emotional response in someone even when they know it was written by a machine throws our previous notions of quality writing out the window.

            <Typography>
                A Robert Frost poem gains meaning and quality when one learns about the life of the man and the experiences that led to the poem. The Star Spangled Banner causes chills when one considers the first person experience of Francis Scott Key witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812. What then causes the emotional reaction to AI generated art? Clearly quality is more than a subjective judgement. While many people really love Top Ramen, even they would concede that the genuine article made at a Japanese restaurant is of superior quality. Thoughts along these lines dovetail nicely with the LEAN and SOLID principals discussed above.

In The Music Lesson he explores what it means to make good music. Similar to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, he explores quality, but from a musical standpoint. The organization of the book bridges the gap between philosophical musings and practical advice for living a more meaningful life. Some of his highest "quality" insights are that of the 12 foundations he outlines [Groove, Notes, Articulation, Technique, Emotion, Dynamics, Rhythm, Tone, Phrasing, Space, Listening] none of them offers a golden ticket but must be understood in combination.

                Similar to some of the insights gained from "Understsanding Complexity" it's the interaction of these that catches our ear. Not many people would say Bob Dylan's voice has a beautiful tone and not many people would say Thelonius Monk hit every note as expected. But as many other singers with silk voices have covered Bob Dylan songs, I find myself coming back to his version with all its nasally roughness and jazz music would not be jazz if it did not take mistakes made in real time and run with them to surprising places.

                What does it mean to live a good life? How do we find meaning in a world where suffering is inflicted through negligence as well as intentional and intentionally senseless cruelty?

I don't mean that he uses big words to describe some of the most barbaric atrocities to have been captured by history. The cruelty he describes was administered in a very calculated and systematic way designed to strip every vestige of humanity from people whose only crime was their birth. His language mirrors this systematic calculation in a way that delivers his ideas as well as drives home the senselessness of the tragedies.

                Dr. Frankl embarks on a journey to find life's meaning. In this quest he found the motivation to get up again and again to face the meaninglessness of life. The central realization is that <b><em>the meaning of life is the search for the meaning of life</em></b>. This point cannot be overstated. If the universe is cold and apathetic to our existence that leaves it to you and me to decide what has meaning and what doesn't. What does it mean to win at life if meaning is self imposed on a meaningless canvas? Finding meaning cannot truly occur without embracing the meaningless. Such contradictions are necessary and have parallels to other great thinkers such as Kurt G&ouml;del (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">the Incompleteness Theorem</a>) and Alan Turing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">the Halting Problem)</a>.

                Again, it is not the concepts nor the language that make this such a difficult read, rather the direct realization of humans' capacity for such horrific cruelty. But from this decomposing morality he finds the compost to grow the most beautiful empathy translating suffering into meaning.

Throughout his career his careful organization of specimins were ruined many times and had to be reconstituted after say the 1906 San Francisco earthquake knocked over and shattered shelves of labeled specimins in jars. The resilience he had to pick up the shards of his life work each time it was destroyed was one of the inspiring sub plots.

                The reason this book is so much more than a history of a controversial taxonomist is clear when she discusses categories. Is a lung fish a fish? It has more in common biologically with a cow than a tuna. We know that dolphins and whales are not fish yet somebody not yet familiar with our classification of mammals might not understand the difference at first. In other words, classifications are not objective and are useful in their context. However, a different classification regime might be more useful in the long run.

The process of creation takes many years yet can be undone by large impact events over night. The author was born in Lebanon and experienced the Lebanese revolution first hand. He saw hundreds of years of development destroyed in a flash of violence. He also worked as a quantitative trader on Wallstreet and published this book mere months before the Housing Market collapsed in 2007-2008.

                Typically we would expect that 68% of the time the market would move up or down within 1 standard deviation of normal; 95% of the time is should fall within 2; 99.7% of the time it should fall within 3. In 2008 the market had many days within short periods of time that were well above those 3 standard deviations. In normal distributions these events should not happen so frequently.

                Taleb refers to these events as <em>Fat Tails</em>. He would suggest that the probabilities should not drop off as quickly as they do in a normal Gaussian bell curve. The tails are the right and left most sections where extremely uncommon events are. A fat tail is a modification of the standard bell curve to account for more unusual events.

                To make the case he draws on the analogy of the computer desktop. The icons do not show the "truth" of the processes going on inside the computer to render their image. Such an acurate representation would make the computer unusable. If in doubt on this point, take out a whiteboard and try going through all the binary operations needed to access your document and add text to it. If you've made it this far then you realize just how far removed our experience of the process is from the reality of the process. This can be extended to all other facets of our experiences.

                One of the more fascinating sections relates to <em>Holography</em>. By capturing the wave interference pattern of light as it interacts with objects in a scene we can recreate the entire three dimensional scene on a two dimenisonal surface. But if you cut that surface into pieces you can use any of those pieces to view the entire holograph. The scene will remain the same size but you will only see as much of it at a time as the size of the piece will allow.
            </Typography>,
            <Typography> 
                Through this he highlights the importance of <em>perspective</em>. The universe is subdivided into perspectives. Each one is able to access the whole, but only as much at a time as can be experienced through a single point of perception. In this framing, the event horizon of a black hole is not an <em>event</em> for the one crossing it, but rather marks the limit of the perspective of the one on the other side.
            </Typography>,
            <Typography>
                A less passive name for <em>perspective</em> can be <em>agent</em>. An agent acts based on what is perceived. An agent can also be subdivided into sub-agents who also act based on what is perceived. Subdivided agents act based on the actions of other agents who then react in a circular fashion. A good conversation is one in which each party hears and responds to the other party who then listens and crafts a response.
            </Typography>,
            <Typography>
                The coup de gr&#226;ce is to follow the logic of subdivision down to its atomic parts. A complex agent such as a human is able to make very complex and complicated decisions. But a human is made of organs. A kidney gets to decide how many electrolytes to allow back into the blood stream after filtering. But a kidney is made of tissues which are made of cells which are made of organelles. At each level the <em>agent</em> is able to make decisions relevant to their experience. The simplest agent one can imagine is a one-bit agent who gets to decide between two states: "Yes" or "No"; "True" or "False". Example of a 1 bit agent might be a neuron or a photo-receptor in your eye. A neuron will fire only if the incoming charge is beyond a threshold. A photo-receptor will only fire if it receives a photon. Combining one-bit agents allows for a great deal of logical complexity.

                Don't be surprised if after reading this book you look at yourself and the world very differently. While certain sections can be challenging, the real difficulty would be remaining unchanged!

                Atomic facts can either be <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> and exist in a logical space where they can be combined into <em>logical objects</em> that contain all possible states of affairs.

                While computer programming languages did not exist when this book was published in 1922, they do provide a helpful framework for understanding his ideas. When a computer is turned on the first thing that happens is that logic is established. From that logic a language is established. From that language processes are triggered. From those processes the rest of the world springs to life. Everytime a computer is started it creates the entire world in which it will operate; a world of facts, not things, that can be traced down to 1's and 0's.
